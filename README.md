“Buch” (German for "book") + "able" = "Buchable"

### Demo

To explore the app, you can either log in to your private server or use the official ABS demo server. The demo server is an nice way to experience the app, especially when testing the web version of Buchable.

**Demo URL:** [https://audiobooks.dev/](https://audiobooks.dev/)  
**Login Credentials:**  
- **Username:** `demo`  
- **Password:** `demo`  

*Note:* Demo user accounts are automatically deleted after 48 hours.

## About

This is a third-party app for the Audiobookshelf server, designed to maintain a single codebase for multiple OS platforms.\
The app is written in Dart and utilizes the Flutter framework.\
While the current version may not include all the features of the first-party app, it is a work in progress with ongoing development.

*<sup>1</sup> iOS functionality requires additional work. Since I do not own a Mac, I cannot fully test it. However, I have only used libraries compatible with iOS.\
*<sup>2</sup> The Audiobookshelf server must be accessible via SSL, so you need a domain with a valid SSL certificate.\
*<sup>3</sup> The web version requires the server to allow CORS.

iOS requires some additional setup to configure the necessary plugins. Unfortunately, I’m unable to test, build, or fix errors on iOS since I don’t have access to a Mac. However, I’ve only used packages and libraries that are compatible with Apple, so once the setup is complete, there shouldn't be any issues building the app for iOS.

As for Linux, the app hasn’t been tested on that platform yet.

### Known Bugs

#### Sleep Timer

- If you select the sleep timer to stop at the end of the chapter, it will stop at the actual time. Skipping the chapter will not adjust the timer.

### Limitations
#### Filters and search
- The search cannot be combined with filters or sorting. This is a limitation of the Audiobookshelf API.
- The search is limited to 25 results, because there is no pagination available. This is a limitation of the Audiobookshelf API.
