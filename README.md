For Android, iOS*<sup>1</sup>, Windows, Linux, and Web*<sup>2</sup>

This is a third-party app for the Audiobookshelf server, designed to maintain a single codebase for multiple OS platforms.\
The app is written in Dart and utilizes the Flutter framework.\
While the current version may not include all the features of the first-party app, it is a work in progress with ongoing development.

*<sup>1</sup> iOS functionality requires additional work. Since I do not own a Mac, I cannot fully test it. However, I have only used libraries compatible with iOS.\
*<sup>2</sup> The Audiobookshelf server must be accessible via SSL, so you need a domain with a valid SSL certificate.

### Known Bugs

#### Sleep Timer

- If you select the sleep timer to stop at the end of the chapter, it will stop at the actual time. Skipping the chapter will not adjust the timer.

#### Sign-in

- When logging in for the first time, the library may not load. Please restart the app to resolve this issue.
